title: Mapping Table
description: Iterations of the `mappingtable` component.

Renders an html table with a header and a body from a csv file. Right now it only supports csv files located in the `src/data/semantic-core` directory, but this can be more flexible in the future.


## Examples

**Default Mapping Table**
```mdoc {% title="Markdoc" %}
{% mappingtable resource="host" /%}
```
<br/>
{% mappingtable resource="host" /%}
